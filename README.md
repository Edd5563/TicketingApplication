# MessengerApp2
Remodeling messenger app with backend functionality

Future changes: 

--A page to help Search for customers by Name, Telephone number, BPID, or Company name

--A Ticket search option where you can plug in a ticket number and it will try to find it.

--A way to search only open tickets

--clock in portion to help keep track of hours.
maybe expand on the tracker to help calculate paychecks





Content to cut:
Messaging page: Ticketing section can cover messaging.

New Ticketing link and page for removal: Having found a way to add it to a modal it makes it 
more user friendly to directly make a ticker from the search results page.

results post call: made it to where its not needed
