#TicketingApplication Beta: 1.8.1
Remodeling an old messenger application I created Months ago. 
This time its a node.js based application with restfulApi/Crud 
functionality and a personalized gui.

Currently being tested at my job for weaknesses and user feedback

Once testing is over, I will implient further changes and additional features.



Future Updates
-- A user profile area.(Debating this feature).

--A modal at the botton for feed back and bug reporting.

--Open ticket maybe be phased out to just have search ticket for Single/All/Open

--Try a tabled view instead of div'ed.

--Spice up the login page....very boring
